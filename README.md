## Install

```shell
snap install nvme-z
```

## Snap configuration

Snaps are confined, as such NVMe-Z may be unable to perform some of the tasks it typically does when unconfined. 
  This may result in the system log getting spammed with apparmor errors. 
  Granting access to the hardware-observe interface when in the snap will enable the features, and thus improve user experience.

```shell
snap connect nvme-z:hardware-observe
```
